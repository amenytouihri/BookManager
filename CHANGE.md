**Change 1: Using modules**  
The code is split into multiple `.py` files containing functions and classes. This increases the modularity and reusability of the code, making it easier to maintain and extend. Each module focuses on a specific functionality, promoting better organization and readability.

**Change 2: Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself (DRY)**
Functions were applied such as `save_book_form` to not repeat code. Using functions is good practice because they promote code reusability, improve readability, and make debugging easier. Functions also help in isolating specific tasks, enabling better testing and reducing the chances of errors. Additionally, they allow for easier collaboration by providing clear interfaces for different parts of the code.
